# Point of Interest (POI) Classification Project

Problem: 
  - Currently, locations may not be properly categorized


Objective:
  - Based on the yelp-dataset, create an RNN model that properly categorizes businesses based on their names


Dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset/data?select=yelp_academic_dataset_business.json

Update 5/4:
  From the yelp dataset, I've been able to identify 1311 categories from the overall dataset.
  There are 2118 lines of categories in the overture maps categories

  Next steps:
    - Match categories from Yelp to overture
    - Start the RNN model architecture
